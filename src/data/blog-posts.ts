      <p>AI character memory is the foundation of personalized conversations. It allows your AI character to remember past interactions, preferences, and context from previous chats.</p>
      <p>The memory system works by storing key information from your conversations and using it to provide more relevant and contextual responses in future interactions.</p>

      <h2>How Character Memory Enhances Your Experience</h2>
      <p>With advanced memory features, your AI character can recall specific details about your preferences, past discussions, and ongoing projects. This creates a seamless conversation flow.</p>
      <p>Premium plans include extended memory capacity, allowing your character to retain more information over longer periods. This is especially useful for professional or educational applications.</p>

      <h2>Optimizing Memory Performance</h2>
      <p>Provide clear and structured information during your initial conversations to help your AI character build a strong knowledge base. The more organized your input, the better the memory retention.</p>
